## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 2 (10/10 = 100.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Excellent. You correctly applied t-SNE (with a sensible PCA(50) pre-step), used labels for coloring, and produced a clear 2D visualization. Parameters are appropriate and reproducible. Consider subsampling for speed on full MNIST if runtime is high.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good job: you trained KNN on 2D t-SNE features and reported accuracy. Your pipeline works and you even noted the leakage caveat from fitting t-SNE on all data. For cleaner evaluation, fit t-SNE on train only (though t-SNE lacks transform).

**Part ex1-part3** (ex1-part3.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Correct: you used UMAP features and computed KNN accuracy. Fit on train and transform test avoids leakage, and k=3 is reasonable. Using 50D UMAP is fine. Nice work.

### Exercise 4 (14/20 = 70.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.code): 7/7 points

_Feedback:_ Good job. You applied PCA (2D/3D), visualized the 2D projection, trained KNN on PCA-transformed data, and reported test accuracy. This meets the task goals. As an optional improvement, you could also try PCA by variance (e.g., PCA(0.9)).

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 7/7 points

_Feedback:_ Well done. You correctly applied UMAP across multiple dimensions, visualized the 2D embedding, and evaluated KNN accuracy on train/test transforms. Code structure mirrors prior PCA workflow appropriately. Commentary is reasonable. Full credit.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 0/6 points

_Feedback:_ Submission contains only placeholder text - no actual student work provided.

### Exercise 1 (20/20 = 100.0%)

**Part pipeline-part1** (pipeline-part1.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Excellent. You correctly apply PCA to 2 components and produce a clear 2D scatter colored by class, with labels and colorbar. Choice of cmap/tab10 and alpha is fine. This fully meets the task requirements.

**Part pipeline-part2** (pipeline-part2.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Excellent work. You fit PCA with 40 components on X_mnist_train, computed percent variance (ratio * 100), and plotted the first 40 components with clear labeling. This meets the scree plot requirements fully.

**Part pipeline-part3** (pipeline-part3.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Correct approach: using PCA with n_components=0.95 and reporting n_components_ directly computes the number of components for 95% variance. Aligned with instructions and prior data usage. Well done.

**Part pipeline-part4** (pipeline-part4.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Well done. You correctly used the PCA from Step 4 (pca_95) to reduce and reconstruct a digit, and visualized original vs reconstructed. Using transform/inverse_transform is appropriate. Using a test digit instead of train is fine here.

**Part pipeline-part5** (pipeline-part5.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Well done. You compared KNN with and without PCA, preserved ~80% variance via PCA(n_components=0.80), correctly fit on train and transformed test, and reported accuracies (and timing). Solid implementation meeting the objective.
